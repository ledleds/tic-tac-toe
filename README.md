# Tic Tac Toe Tech Test

## Brief

Build the business logic for a game of tic tac toe. It should be easy to implement a working game of tic tac toe by combining your code with any user interface, whether web or command line.

## User Stories

These are the user stories I wrote in response to the brief.

```
As a user
So that I can have fun
I want to play against a friend
```

```
As a user
So that I can have fun
I want to choose which player I want to be (X, or O)
```

```
As a user
So that I have a better chance at winning
I want to be able to claim a field if it isn't taken
```

```
As a user
So that I can be crowned 'the winner'
I want to win if I claim all fields in a row, column or diagonal
```

```
As a user
So that the game can end
I want the game to be over once all fields are taken
```
